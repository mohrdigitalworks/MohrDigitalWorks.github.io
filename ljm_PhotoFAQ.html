<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Why_are_my_indoor_pictures_ORANGE"></a>Why are
my indoor pictures ORANGE?</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Indoor pictues under standard lighting have an orange/red color. Most
modern cameras use AUTO COLOR BALANCE to attempt to correct for
different colors of light in a scene. However, this is not perfect and
sometimes produces an ORANGE cast. Most cameras allow you to set
the WHITE BALANCE from AUTO to TUNGSTEN or INCANDESCENT and this should
remove the color cast.<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">NOTE: make sure to RESET
the WHITE BALANCE back to AUTO or you will have problems with outdoor
photos.<br>

&nbsp;<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Why_are_my_outdoor_picture_deep_BLUE"></a>Why
are my outdoor picture deep BLUE?</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
You have probably set the camera's WHITE BALANCE to TUNGSTEN or
INCANDESCENT to remove the ORANGE from an indoor scene.<br>
This causes any outdoor scenes to appear BLUE. Reset the camera's WHITE
BALANCE to AUTO and this should be corrected.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Why_do_some_of_my_prints_have_part_of"></a>Why
do some of my prints have part of the image cropped off?</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Short answer: The default setting when printing is to fill the print
with the image. If the image is a different proportion from the print,
some of the image<br>
is cropped off. For example, if your image is
SQUARE, you would find some of the top and bottom of the image cropped
off of a 4x6" print..<br>
To correct this you need to use a special
setting when ordering the print. Please contact us for instructions on
using FIT instead of FILL when making prints.<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Always preview images at

<span style="font-style: italic;">At any zoom ratio other

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Should_I_keep_a_copy_of_my_images"></a>Should I
keep a copy of my images?</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
YES! It is recommended that you have THREE copies of your images. ONE
of these copies should be somewhere NOT ON THE SAME PREMISES as the
other TWO. After some research it is my opinion that you should make
NEW backup copies of your photos about every TWO years. Reguardless of
whether you are backing up on CD/.DVD/bluray, Flash drive or Hard
drives, media can fail. Even if you backup in the "Cloud" you cannont
be sure that your photos will be accessable years from now. With
negatives, slides and prints, backing up was expensive, with digital
media backups are relatively cheap.<br>
<a name="What_is_IMAGE_STABILIZATION_"></a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What is IMAGE
STABILIZATION ?</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a camera feature that attempts
to reduce the loss of sharpness in an image due to camera movement.<br>
Since cameras are no longer held against the face, they are more
succeptable to CAMERA SHAKE.<br>
Each camera maker has their own term for this feature.<br>
VIBRATION REDUCTION - IMAGE STABILIZATION - SHAKE REDUCTION - OPTICAL
IMAGE STABILIZATION (OIS)<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="I_color_correct_my_images_before_I_bring"></a>I
color correct my images before I bring them in but the prints don't
look the same. What am I doing wrong?</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This simple question is one of the greatest headaches in digital
imaging. In the old days of negatives you didn't have an expectation of
how your prints would look because if you looked at your
negatives, you couldn't tell what they would look like. With slides you
had a positive image to look at but your prints still looked different.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Today, everyone has seen some version of their digital image on a
monitor and wonders why the prints don't match!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is extremely complex but I
will try to keep it as simple as possible.<br>
- an old style CRT screen produced color by glowing phosphors.<br>
- a LCD screen has colored filters lit by a florescent backlite.<br>
- an injet printer produces color using dyes or pigments sprayed onto
paper viewed by reflected light.<br>
- a photographic paper print has dyes in an emulsion layer on the paper
viewed by reflected light.<br>
All
these display methods have different "color spaces" - which simply
means
thay they each display a different subset of the possible colors.<br>
In order to have the best chance of having what you see on your monitor
appear in the print is to "Calibrate" your monitor.<br>
This
does NOT match the monitor to the print. What is does is to set the
color , brightness and contrast of your monitor to a set STANDARD so
you have the best chance of a print made from your image file looking
close to your monitor. A Calibrated device should have the widest range
of
grayscale viewable with little color cast (ie the grays should be a
clean neutral gray without a color cast). The contrast and brightness
should be
optimal&nbsp;for that device.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><br>
Photo Tip </span><br>
Here are a couple of links to Calibration Images that you can download
and view on your monitor to see if you have any problems.<br>

Download the images and look at them on your monitor.<br>
Is the skin tone good?<br>
Are the grey patches grey without a color cast?<br>
Can
you see ALL the different &nbsp;shades in the grey patches?
(usually
for most monitors some of the end patches will look the same)<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="My_software_says_that_my_image_is"></a>My
software says that my image is 8"x10", why does it not make a good
8"x10" when you print it?</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any software that says your image will print or "IS" a certain print
size is misleading you. A digital image only has a "size" when it is
printed, and that size depends on the "DPI" or "Dots Per Inch" at which
the output device prints or displays.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for example, take an image that is
1200pixels by 1800pixels and display it or print it with NO RESIZING.<br>
&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
On your display which is probably 72DPI, it would display as about
16.6"x25" so you would only see a small part of the image on your
screen.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On our Frontier printer at 300DPI, it would make a nice 4"x6" print.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On an inkjet printer it would likely print as an 8"x12" print</span>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also, remember that when you look at an image on your monitor, you are
seeing the display software's interpretation of the image unless you
are viewing at 100% zoom.<br>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="What_resolution_should_I_use_when"></a>What
resolution should I use when scanning?</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The answer to this question is quite complex. It depends on what media
you are scanning from and what you want to do with the resulting image
file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
prints you can
usually simply scan at 300DPI and you should get an image that will
print at the same size as the original.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For negatives and slides you neet much
higher
resolution. When I am scanning I always set the scan for the size of
the image I want to end up with.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
example:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a 35mm
slide ( 1"x1.5") and I want to make 8x10" prints. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excellent
quality results are usually obtained by printing at 300DPI ( in fact,
this is the resolution that our big printer at work uses), so
8x300=2400 pixels by 10x300=3000 pixels. I would set the output size of
the scan to be 2400x3000 pixels. This just scratches the surface of the
complex art of scanning.<br>
